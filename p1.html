<h1><a id="Heathrow">Heathrow info</a></h1>
<br>Located in the London Borough of Hillingdon, Heathrow is by far the largest of London's airports, and considered the international gateway into the United Kingdom. Heathrow has 5 terminals, and two parallel runways. Due to the location in London's western suburbs, Heathrow cannot expand (especially since the Cameron ministry scrapped the proposals for a third runway on 12 May 2010[6]), and as a result consistently runs at 99% capacity. This has led to Heathrow being one of the worst rated airports in the world, with lengthy border control queues being a recent problem.[7] The airport is connected to Great Britain's motorway network via the M4 and M25 motorways.

In April 2012, Heathrow announced that for the first time in history it handled 70 million passengers in a calendar year,[8] making it the third busiest airport in the world in terms of passenger numbers, after Atlanta and Beijing. It is also the busiest airport in the world in terms of international passenger numbers, as well as the busiest airport in United Kingdom and the busiest in Europe, again, both in terms of passenger numbers.

Heathrow serves six continents around the world, and is the base for the flag carrier British Airways in Terminal 5. While it does serve short-haul flights, it is London's hub for long distance flights, with it being the most popular destination for the whole of the United States of America, with 13 million passengers. However, because of its high capacity rates, London has failed to serve cities in the newly industrialized countries, like China, falling away from European bases like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Paris.

<h1><a id="Gatwick">Gatwick info</a></h1><br>
<br>Located in West Sussex, Gatwick is the second busiest airport in the London metropolitan region, and is the busiest single runway airport in the world. It is currently the second busiest airport in the United Kingdom after Heathrow, and the 10th busiest in Europe. It is the second base for British Airways, serving Europe and the Caribbean. It is also the base for low-cost carriers like Monarch, easyJet and Flybe.

The airport consists of two terminals, North and South, is connected to the motorway network via the M23, and has its own railway station, with Gatwick Express serving Victoria station in Central London.

<h1><a id="Stansted">Stansted info</a></h1>
<br>Located in Essex, Stanstedmap3 is London's third busiest airport, being the fourth busiest in the United Kingdom, behind Manchester Airport, 26th busiest in Europe, and is one of the primary operational bases for Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair. Stansted destinations are largely in Europe, however in the past it has served destinations further afield, like Kuala Lumpur. It is the home of Harrods Aviation, allowing VIP aircraft to land there, such as Air Force One carrying the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in 2009.[9]
